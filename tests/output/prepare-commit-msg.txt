The 'prepare-commit-msg' hook has found issues in your commit message. Your commit message: My commit message. A commit message should begin with '[FEATURE]', '[TASK]', '[BUGFIX]', '[DOCS]' or '[CLEANUP]'. Additionally you can prepend '[!!!]' for breaking changes or '[WIP]' for changes that aren't fully finished. If this behavior is not intended, please open a issue containing your commit message on the following bug tracker. https://github.com/sitegeist/git-hooks/issues\n
